# Qaree-App

Qaree is a digital product aiming to facilitate group reading by enabling readers to create group cycles online. In addition, individual readers can use Qaree to track their reading status and keep a record of their achievements. Qaree will target regular readers, but also other sectors of Saudi Arabiaâ€™s society. That would result in enriching the culture of society and promoting reading between its members. Current products mainly target English-speaking audience with little or no support of Arabic. Some digital products can be used regardless of the language barrier. However, with a socially heavy activity like group reading, it is a must to have a platform that is tailored for local needs and culture. That is where Qaree will fill this gap and provide the desired solution. 

### Conventions

#### Creating a New Branch

Once you're assigned to an issue or want to start working on a new feature, create a new branch with a descriptive title preceded with your name as `@yourname/new-feature-title`.

_Note: branch names ar all small case separated by a dash `-`, e.g. `@Abdulkareem/booking-bug`_

#### Commits & PR

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

* **fix:** a commit of the type `fix` patches a bug in the codebase.

* **new:** a commit of the type `new` introduces a new feature to the codebase.

* **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking change.

* types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
 
Refer to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for more information. 


#### Dart File Naming
* Small letters only.
* Use underscore as delimiters.
* Keep it short, clear and simple.

Examples :
`main_view.dart`
`settings_controller.dart`
